AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun) and its wrapper [quick-sharun](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-AppImages/blob/main/useful-tools/quick-sharun.sh), which makes it easy and reliable to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks. 

**This AppImage bundles everything and it should work on any Linux distro, including old and musl-based ones.**

This AppImage doesn't require FUSE to run at all, thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime).

This AppImage is also supplied with the seamless self-updater by default, so any updates to this application won't be missed.  
Self-updater doesn't run if AppImage managers like [am](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) or [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) exist, which manage AppImage integration and updates.

## Known quirks

- QR code camera and screenshot scanning for the receiver only works if the camera and screenshot freedesktop portal is installed on the host (same as upstream).
- If portable `.config` and/or `.home` directory is used, app fails to detect `XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR` when receiving the file.  
  This part should be patched to handle it:  
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/warp/-/blob/main/src/ui/fs.rs#L11-20  
  - Meanwhile, without those 2 portable folders, only `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/warp/config.json` would be made on the host, which you can delete after the app uninstallation.
- Help page only works if `gnome-help` or other similar `.page` viewer is installed on the host's system.  
Bundling the help page viewer in the AppImage would make it work everywhere, but it's both bad for the file size and [security](https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2025/04/15/dangerous-arbitrary-file-read-vulnerability-in-yelp-cve-2025-3155/), hence why we don't do that.
  - `gnome-help` v49.0 doesn't work with Help section of our GTK AppImages for some reason, while older versions, like v42.3 work.
